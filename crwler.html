<h2><a name="part1"><font face="Old English Text MT">1.Astronomy</font></a></h2>


<p>Astronomy lessons are spent learning <br>
the names of stars and the movements of <br>
planets. It is a required class for the first five<br>
 years of study, and is optional in the last two.</p>

<p>In fifth year the Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations <br>
are taken. During the exam students must fill in a blank star<br>
 chart. If a student achieves a passing O.W.L.<br>
 score, they are allowed to advance to N.E.W.T.-level.</p>

<p>Astronomy is one of the only fields of study at Hogwarts<br>
 which has a direct equivalent in the Muggle world. Known <br>
student activities include learning the names of stars, <br>
constellations, and planets, as well as their location and <br>
movements, and describing the environments of planets and moons.</p>

<p>Wiseacre's Wizarding Equipment in Diagon Alley sells <br>
telescopes and other equipment needed for Astronomy.</p>

<p>Aurora Sinistra was the Astronomy professor at Hogwarts <br>
during Harry Potter's time as a student.</p>

in Hogwarts Castle, and include sky observation <br>
sessions with telescopes (each student has to buy one of his/her own).</p>

<h2><a name="part2"><font face="Old English Text MT">2.Defence Against the Dark Arts</font></a></h2>


<p> Defence Against the Dark Arts is a required <br>
subject from first year to fifth year. <br>
The curriculum of the class varies <br>
greatly depending on what the professor at the<br>
 time deems appropriate. Due to the jinx on the <br>
teaching post that was present before Lord <br>
Voldemort died, many teachers have been appointed to this post.</p>

<p>Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson<br>
1994 Defence Against the Dark Arts <br>
lesson on the Unforgivable Curses<br>
The lessons generally have a practical<br>
 approach, with many of the teachers <br>
(except Dolores Umbridge) believing that when<br>
 it comes to the Dark Arts a practical approach <br>
is the best way, with theoretical assignments <br>
given as homework.</p>

<p>In the fifth year Ordinary Wizarding <br>
Level examinations are taken; as such, <br>
students are spent learning new topics and <br>
possibly revisiting the past four years of lessons <br>
(depending on the teacher). As part of their <br>
Defence Against the Dark Arts O.W.L., <br>
students must sit a written exam one of the questions <br>
asks to describe the five signs of a werewolf and after <br>
students must complete a practical exam of; <br>
counter-jinxes, defensive spells, Riddikulus, and <br>
the Patronus Charm (for bonus points).</p>

<p>To advance to the N.E.W.T. class a student must <br>
first achieve a high O.W.L. score of either 'Outstanding'<br>
 or 'Exceeds Expectations'; most teachers set the bar at <br>
'Exceeds Expectations'.</p>

<p>Also, due to the course being directly related to <br>
the Dark Arts itself, dark wizards who wish to teach <br>
would typically apply for this course, notably being <br>
Lord Voldemort and Severus Snape.</p>

<p>Location and curriculumClassrooms<br>
Defence Against the Dark Arts classes <br>
take place on the first-floor, Class 104 in <br>
the North Tower and Classroom 3C on the<br>
 third-floor. In Classroom 3C, an iron<br>
 chandelier hung from the ceiling, as well <br>
as a dragon's skeleton. On one end of the <br>
classroom stands a projector that is activated <br>
by magic. Several desks and tables can be found in<br> 
the classroom as well as some sets of large windows.</p>

<h2><a name="part3"><font face="Old English Text MT">3.History</font></a></h2>


<P>History of Magic is a core class and subject taught <br>
at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. <br>
This class is a study of magical history. <br>
This is one of the subjects where the use of <br>
magic practically isn't necessary. History of Magic <br>
is taught from the first year to the fifth, with the <br>
option of N.E.W.T. courses in sixth and seventh year.</P>

<P>The professor of this subject taught at Hogwarts <br>
for many years before his death he was Cuthbert <br>
Binns and even after his death he continued teaching as a ghost.</P>
<p><a href="#part0">Back to beginning </a></p>
<h2><a name="part4"><font face="Old English Text MT">4.Magical Creatures </font></a></h2>
<p>Care of Magical Creatures is a subject taught only <br>
to those in their third year or above who choose to take it.</p>

<p>In a students fifth year they take <br>
the Ordinary Wizarding Level examination <br>
where they sit both a written portion and a practical <br>
portion, were they demonstrate their knowledge. <br>
On their Care of Magical Creatures practical they <br>
had to identify a knarl hidden among a dozen hedgehogs; <br>
demonstrate correct handling of a bowtruckle; feed and <br>
clean out a fire crab without sustaining serious burns; <br>
choose from a wide selection of food the diet they would give a sick unicorn.</p>

<p>It is unknown how many of Harry Potter's <br>
fellow students chose to continue Care of Magical<br>
 Creatures in their N.E.W.T. year; however, Harry, <br>
Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger left the subject <br>
after completing their O.W.L.s</p>



<p><a href="#part0">Back to beginning </a></p>




<h2><a name="part5"><font face="Old English Text MT">5.Potions</font></a></h2>
<p>Potions is a core class and subject taught at <br>
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. <br>
In this class, students learn the correct way to <br>
brew potions. They follow specific recipes and <br>
use various magical ingredients to create the potions,<br>
 starting with simple ones and moving to more<br>
 advanced ones as they progress in knowledge. <br>
A standard potions kit includes plant ingredients such <br>
as Belladonna and supplies such as glass phials and weighing scales.</p>

<p>The professor of this subject is referred to <br>
as a potions master. The potions master at <br>
Hogwarts for many years was Horace Slughorn <br>
and later Severus Snape. It is unknown if Professor <br>
Slughorn stayed as potions master or if someone <br>
else took over following the Second Wizarding War.</p>

<p><a href="#part0">Back to beginning </a></p>


<h2><a name="part6"><font face="Old English Text MT">6.Transfiguration</font></a></h2>
<p>Transfiguration is a core class and subject <br>
taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft <br>
and Wizardry. It teaches the art of changing the <br>
form and appearance of an object. This type of <br>
magic is commonly referred to as "Transfiguration".<br>
 There are limits to Transfiguration, which are <br>
governed by Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration.<br>
There are also many branches, including Cross-Species <br>
Transfiguration and Human Transfiguration. <br>
This type of magic is regarded as "very hard work" <br>
and is "more scientific" than any other subject. <br>
One has to get it exactly right for the transfiguration to be successful.</p>


<p>Transfiguration is achieved through concentration, <br>
precise wand movements, and the proper <br>
pronunciation of an incantation. <br>
However it is generally more difficult <br>
than Charms and requires great effort.</p>
